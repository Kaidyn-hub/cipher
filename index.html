      <h2>🧩 Chapter 1: The Base45 Whisper</h2>
      <p>
        In the age of QR codes and space-limited messages, Base45 emerged as a quiet savior.
        Unlike its cousins Base64 or Base32, Base45 compactly encodes binary into a set of 45 readable characters. 
        Used in European COVID certificates, it tells machines what humans cannot see.
        But beware — decoding it requires precision, for every trio becomes a pair!

      <h2>📦 Chapter 2: Crockford’s Clean Code</h2>
      <p>
        Douglas Crockford disliked ambiguity. In his realm, Base32 was reborn — stripped of confusing letters like "O" and "I".
        His Base32-Crockford used only safe characters: no case sensitivity, no confusion, and with error-detecting checks.
        It was designed for humans, not just machines — a clean, readable way to pass secrets between allies.

      <h2>🏛️ Chapter 3: Caesar’s Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Long ago, in Roman times, Caesar shifted the alphabet. By rotating letters by a fixed amount, he masked his intentions.
        'HELLO' became 'KHOOR' with a shift of 3. Though simple and easy to break today, his cipher taught the world the basics of encryption.
        His legacy echoes in every shift-based cipher used in puzzles and CTFs.
